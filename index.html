            n NASA's Twin Study, astronaut Scott Kelly spent nearly a year on the International Space Station, while his identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, remained on Earth as a control subject. Scientists discovered that 7% of Scott's gene expression was altered after his time in space, affecting things like immune response, DNA repair, bone formation, and oxygen use. Some of these changes persisted months after he returned to Earth.

This showed that long-duration spaceflight can trigger significant biological changes, which is critical knowledge as we plan missions to Mars and beyond. Space literally reshapes us.
